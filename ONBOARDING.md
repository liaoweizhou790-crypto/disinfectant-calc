## How This Works

When your agent sees this file with `state: not_started` or `in_progress`, it knows to help you complete setup. You can:

1. **Interactive mode** — Answer questions in one session (~10 min)
2. **Drip mode** — Agent asks 1-2 questions naturally over several days
3. **Skip for now** — Agent works immediately, learns from conversation

Say "let's do onboarding" to start, or "ask me later" to drip.
